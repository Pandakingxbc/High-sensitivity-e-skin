In this file, I will introduce the environment that I used, including the software and hardware environment
The equipment: 
Microcomputer: ESP32-C6-DevKitM-1 *1
Amplifier unit: LM358 * 2
PC: LEGION*1
FPGA IDE: Arduino IDE
Multi-resistance and multi-line
(Notice: I only consider the 4*4 matrix for simply show it's working principle, of course it can be expanded into 20*20 and so on)

test tool: different types of needles
